    "In order to test my hypothesis, I want to create a sample set of educational, and helpful comments. However, I will occasionally throw in \"f$@#\" and \"sh1t\" into some of the comments. Some of the cuss words I will have a numerical \"fake\" form of it, and some of the words I will put in directly without any censored letters. I think that even if the helpful and educational comments are not toxicly directed at anyone, just having the word in there will affect the score immediately. "

    "Since I had a lower sample size, the pros of that is I can just run the code and see the ouput easily. The cons is that there is not a lot of data to make a solid conclusion about. However, I was correct in guessing that just one cuss word can drastically change the threshold level to above a 0.5, even in a positive and educational comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of more vague comments and hidden cuss words would be the one where there are numbers in the dirty words. For example, using sh1t instead of the actual word, or f4ck instead of the actual word. One of the comments uses SH1T and passes the threshold test and is considered nontoxic. It is \"Philosophy challenges us to think SH1T critically and examine our beliefs\", and it had a score of 0.37073207. I previously placed the level at 0.5, so it would not have gone over this number to be marked as toxic. Meanwhile, the comment \"Literature teaches empathy asss and critical thinking\" ended up with a score of 0.52272606. This comment would have been marked as toxic, even though some users might just talk in a way with extra letters like \"thissss\" or \"thattt\". \n",
